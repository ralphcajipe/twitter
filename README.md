## Machine Learning

* [Machine Learning in Filipino](https://twitter.com/ralphcode/status/1370373330247643137?s=20) — I realized the Filipino for Machine Learning can be "Pagkatuto ng Makina", "Makinang pinapa aral", or it can be "Makinang nag-aaral".  It's important to use our language when communicating technology locally. Native language- they can easily convey a quick understanding. Literacy

* [Real-world Machine Learning](https://twitter.com/ralphcode/status/1392444265741963268?s=20) — In real-world machine learning systems that model things change frequently, such as weather or traffic, it's common to set up an automated training process to run on a regular basis, such as daily or weekly. This keeps the system up-to-date as the data changes.

* [Machine Learning Model in a Real Application](https://twitter.com/ralphcode/status/1392446624425603072?s=20) — When using a machine learning model in a real application: you should test the accuracy of new models before using them to replace an existing model, and you should consider retraining the model on a regular basis as data changes.

## Software Engineering

* [Write Unit tests](https://twitter.com/ralphcode/status/1475880044819992577) — Write unit tests for your software, while it is still small. Learn why testing is important, what unit tests look like, how to write unit tests, and how to run them.
