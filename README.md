## Machine Learning

* [Machine Learning in Filipino](https://twitter.com/ralphcode/status/1370373330247643137?s=20) — I realized the Filipino for Machine Learning can be "Pagkatuto ng Makina", "Makinang pinapa aral", or it can be "Makinang nag-aaral".  It's important to use our language when communicating technology locally. Native language- they can easily convey a quick understanding. Literacy

* [Main Challenges of Machine Learning](https://twitter.com/ralphcode/status/1397025964945657860?s=20) — Main Challenges of Machine Learning:
• Insufficient Quantity of Training Data
• Nonrepresentative Training Data
• Poor-Quality Data
• Irrelevant Features
• Overfitting the Training Data
• Underfitting the Training Data

* [ 5 Advantages of TensorFlow library for Machine Learning](https://twitter.com/ralphcode/status/1398497866381881350?s=20) — I see 5 Advantages of TensorFlow library for Machine Learning. 1. Data Visualization 2. Google Cloud Function 3. TensorFlow Graphics 4. Tools and Support 5. Powerful Library. Its wrapper libraries to simplify the process of fast numerical computing are state of the art.

* [Machine Learning and Computer Vision](https://twitter.com/ralphcode/status/1398611939677204480?s=20) — Machine Learning and Computer Vision are just some of the branches of A.I. but these two have become increasingly interconnected. Computer vision has advanced in terms of recognition and tracking thanks to machine learning.

## Machine Learning in the Real World

* [Real-world Machine Learning](https://twitter.com/ralphcode/status/1392444265741963268?s=20) — In real-world machine learning systems that model things change frequently, such as weather or traffic, it's common to set up an automated training process to run on a regular basis, such as daily or weekly. This keeps the system up-to-date as the data changes.

* [Machine Learning Model in a Real Application](https://twitter.com/ralphcode/status/1392446624425603072?s=20) — When using a machine learning model in a real application: you should test the accuracy of new models before using them to replace an existing model, and you should consider retraining the model on a regular basis as data changes.

* [The Skywalker Hand Powered by TensorFlow](https://twitter.com/ralphcode/status/1392553706839699456?s=20) — This is amputee musician Jason Barnes and his Skywalker Hand developed by @GeorgiaTech. It will let him live his drumming thanks to ultrasound signals and A.I. that uses machine learning. He was the the first to use the Skywalker Hand inspired from Star Wars. Multiple musical notesDrum

## Software Engineering

* [Write Unit tests](https://twitter.com/ralphcode/status/1475880044819992577) — Write unit tests for your software, while it is still small. Learn why testing is important, what unit tests look like, how to write unit tests, and how to run them.
