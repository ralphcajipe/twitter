It has accelerated machine learning workloads effectively, especially for those who are prototyping like me and don't have a high-end PC. I enjoy writing notebook-based models so far.

* [A nice appetizer to get you into machine learning](https://twitter.com/ralphcode/status/1405870352656310274?s=20) — A nice appetizer to get you into machine learning. This free tutorial by #w3schools has real-world examples of using traditional ML library — scikit-learn and tools like NumPy, pandas, & Matplotlib. It's light & a good read to feed for your brain :)

## Machine Learning in the Real World

* [Real-world Machine Learning](https://twitter.com/ralphcode/status/1392444265741963268?s=20) — In real-world machine learning systems that model things change frequently, such as weather or traffic, it's common to set up an automated training process to run on a regular basis, such as daily or weekly. This keeps the system up-to-date as the data changes.

* [Machine Learning Model in a Real Application](https://twitter.com/ralphcode/status/1392446624425603072?s=20) — When using a machine learning model in a real application: you should test the accuracy of new models before using them to replace an existing model, and you should consider retraining the model on a regular basis as data changes.

* [The Skywalker Hand Powered by TensorFlow](https://twitter.com/ralphcode/status/1392553706839699456?s=20) — This is amputee musician Jason Barnes and his Skywalker Hand developed by @GeorgiaTech. It will let him live his drumming thanks to ultrasound signals and A.I. that uses machine learning. He was the the first to use the Skywalker Hand inspired from Star Wars. Multiple musical notesDrum

* [Experts in AI or Machine Learning](https://twitter.com/ralphcode/status/1400467645917323266?s=20) — Most people that are experts in AI or machine learning of this time usually have one specialization.
